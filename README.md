# Useful Notes

These are my personal notes I refer to for this language.

How to use:
1. Download and navigate to the directory for these files
2. Open the terminal and type `make`
3. Type `./output` to run the program
4. Type `make clean` to remove the compiled files

This program requires [MinGW](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html "Download MinGW from https://nuwen.net") to run on Windows. Install on the main drive and add it to the PATH.
